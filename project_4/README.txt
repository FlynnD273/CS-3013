We started off with the skeleton code for the map, store, and load methods. We didn't bother with user input in the beginning, since it was more useful to get the memory methods working before doing anything else. So in the maub nethod we just called the memory methods manually at first. We originally made it so that each page table entry was stored in 3 bytes. One for the VPM, one for the frame number, and one for the permission bit, just so it was fewer things to debug. Once we got all three methods working, we switched to using a single byte to store all three values using bitshifts and bitmasks. After that was working, we then made it so that it would attempt to map more memory on an invalid store call.
